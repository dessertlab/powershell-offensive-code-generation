In this case we are searching for the 'password' pattern:
Get a PSSession
String Obfuscation, Obfuscates a string (e.g., a command) using Base64 encoding to evade detection by security tools.
Here's an example of dumping local password hashes (hashdump) using nishang Get-PassHashes module:

Search readable shares

Automatic using raiseChild.py This is an Impacket script which will automate escalating from child to parent domain. The script needs:   Target domain controller  Creds for an admin user in the child domain  The flow is:   Obtains the SID for the Enterprise Admins group of the parent domain  Retrieves the hash for the KRBTGT account in the child domain  Creates a Golden Ticket  Logs into the parent domain  Retrieves credentials for the Administrator account in the parent domain  If the `target-exec` switch is specified, it authenticates to the parent domain's Domain Controller via Psexec.
