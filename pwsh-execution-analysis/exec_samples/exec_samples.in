88 Perform password spraying attack (assuming that passwords might be re-used elsewhere), Search for string pattern in registry, The following PowerShell command will sift through the selected registry hives (HKCR, HKCU, HKLM, HKU, and HKCC) and recursively search for any chosen pattern within the registry key names or data values. In this case we are searching for the 'password' pattern:
91 Here's an example of dumping local password hashes (hashdump) using nishang Get-PassHashes module:
95 Get GPO of an OU
97 PortForwarding Since we have Local Administrator on the intermediate target bizintel: 10.35.8.17, you can add a port forwarding rule to send your requests to the final/third server secdev: 10.35.8.23.  Can quickly use netsh to rip out a one-liner and add the rule.
98 Find configuration files containing 'password' string, With this command we can locate files containing a certain pattern, e.g. here were are looking for a 'password' pattern in various textual configuration files:
100 Host discovery using mass DNS reverse lookup, Using this command we can perform quick reverse DNS lookup on the 10.10.1.0/24 subnet and see if there are any resolvable (potentially alive) hosts.The results will be then saved in the ip_hostname.txt file in the current working directory.
102 Create a guest SMB shared drive, Here's a cool trick to quickly start a SMB (CIFS) network shared drive accessible by anyone:
103 Using Alternate Data Streams for Evasion, Hides malicious commands or data in alternate data streams of files, which is a method often used to evade detection.
104 Get SID of the current user, The following command will return SID value of the current user, Check if we are running with elevated (admin) privileges:
105 File Path Obfuscation, Obfuscates a file path using Base64 encoding, making it harder to detect malicious file paths or commands.
108 Get info of current forest (no external)
